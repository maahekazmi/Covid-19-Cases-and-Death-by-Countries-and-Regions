# Covid-19-Cases-and-Death-by-Countries-and-Regions
The goal of this project is to examine the relationship between Covid-19 cases and deaths by countries and regions. I examined the top 15 countries that had the highest number of reported cases and deaths. I looked at the total number of cases and the total number of deaths. Additionally, I examined the recent number of new cases and deaths for the top regions from the last seven days. This was based on the population per 100k. The data was extracted from a set found on Kaggle. It is important to note that although the data is analyzed from confirmed cases, many Covid-19 cases have gone unreported. This may affect the accuracy of the results from the data. Moreover, there was no method describing how the values were reported. This opens up the possibility for sampling bias, where not all cases and deaths would be reported.
